I'm a computer science student and machine learning researcher at the University of Waterloo. 

Currently, I'm working on [Eclipse](https://eclipsecard.net), a smart digital wallet app, which is now available for download on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/eclipse-cashback-and-rewards/id6444634565)!

My current research can be found [here](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jrwallace/swiftnlp). I'm building a cool Swift package for NLP topic modeling, for health researchers :)
